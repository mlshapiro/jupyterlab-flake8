# Jupyterlab-flake8

Jupyterlab extension to lint python notebooks and python files in the text editor. Uses [`flake8`](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) python library for linting.

> Note: This extension will only work if you can load the terminal in jupyterlab. The terminal does [not currently work on Windows 7](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/3647)

## Prerequisites

- JupyterLab >= 2.x

```bash
$ conda install jupyterlab -c conda-forge
```

> To install the extension for JupyterLab 1.x, use version `jupyterlab-flake8@0.5.0`

- [`flake8`](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) python package

```bash
$ conda install flake8   # if using conda
$ pip install flake8     # if using pip
```

## Installation

For JupyterLab 3.x:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab-flake8
```

For JupyterLab 2.x:

```bash
jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-flake8@0.6.1
```


## Usage

When the extension is installed, the linter will automatically be toggled on and configured to show error messages. The linter will run when you change cells.

The linter will run on state change of the notebook or the text editor. State changes occur when the document is saved, the cell is changed, or on some carriage returns.

## Settings

Plugin is configured in the Jupyter Lab _Advanced Settings_.
If you are using a specific conda environment, you must explicitly set this environment in the `conda_env` variable of the plugin settings.

Toggle shortcuts are also available in the view menu:

- Enable Flake8
  - Turns on or off linting in the notebook
- Output Flake8 Browser Console Logs
  - Turn on browser console logs for debugging the extension

## Configure Flake8

The notebook linter is configured the same way as the `flake8` command line tool. See the [`flake8` project configuration documentation](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html#project-configuration) for all options.

As an example, if you want to ignore certain warnings:

- Create `.flake8` file in the same directory as the notebook
- Specify a `[flake8]` block in a valid INI format

```ini
[flake8]
ignore =
    F812,   # list comprehension redefines
    H101    # Use TODO(NAME)
exclude =
    .git,
    __pycache__,
    docs/source/conf.py,
    dist
max-complexity = 10
```

The `flake8` linter will then use this configuration in the notebook.

## TODO

Please help contribute if you have time and think this is useful. I will continue to improve as I have time:

- make lint frequency a configurable option

## Development

It is advisable to use a seperate conda environment for development:

```bash
$ conda create -n jlflake8 anaconda
```

For a development install (requires npm version 4 or later), do the following in the repository directory:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ jupyter labextension install              # install and rebuild jupyterlab
$ jupyter labextension install --no-build   # install, but don't build (built during `jupyter lab --watch`)
```

To rebuild the package and the JupyterLab app:

```bash
$ npm run build
$ jupyter lab build
```

To run jupyter lab and thet typescript in watch mode:

```bash
$ jupyter lab --watch       # in the first terminal window
$ npm run watch             # in a new terminal window
```

Every time you add a dependency you much re-run `npm run watch`, then `jupyter lab --watch`
